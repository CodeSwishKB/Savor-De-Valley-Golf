				<h1>Our History</h1>
				<p>April 27, 2023, our restaurant began its journey as a mere school project in our ICT program. Our
					instructor tasked us to create a website that would showcase the restaurant that we envisioned to
					build. With a simple combination of HTML elements, CSS rules, and a little bit of JavaScript, six
					students from Grade 12 ICT - Kyle, Ruffa, Althea, JC, Lloyd, and Justine - worked together to create
					a website that would eventually become the foundation of our restaurant's online presence. These
					students put together a menu list that featured a variety of delectable food items, refreshing
					drinks, and mouth-watering desserts that would be available at our restaurant. What started as a
					school project has now become a reality, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for our
					restaurant.</p>
